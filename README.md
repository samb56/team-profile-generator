  ## Description 
  Uses user input to generate profile cards for employees with basic info displayed. Currently set up for 3 catagories of employees: manager, intern, and engineer. Displays the employees: name, title, email, and ID number as well as: GitHub link, office number, or school(where applicable). The script can generator can create as many profiles as you like and can be used to make a display a professional team. Great for quickly creating a basic html setup of profile cards.

  ## Installation 
  Install the zip folder and extract all of the contents. Access the directory within a terminal and run the command "node index.js" to initiate the script.

  ## Usage 
  Open the terminal for the index.js and use the node index.js command. Prompts will ask for the data needed and once you have finished creating all of the employee profiles one needs, the html file will be generated in the directory the index is saved in.
